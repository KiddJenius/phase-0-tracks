# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control keeps track of an evolving project using various save points to assist in effeciency and workability, esp between several users.  It's useful bc it creates a traceable construct and log map, which helps participants either continue to build on or fix problems if they exist in a program.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a side trail you can take to manipulate code.  The good thing about branches is you can work freely on them without disrupting the master pipeline, and only adding the branch when it is suitable.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a conscious action to add to a directory, file, or program.  Since anytime you commit there is some sort of change, a commit message should be as short and concise as possible about the changes that reference that commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

When your current branch and the branch you want to merge into have currently diverged.  You need to make a COMMIT-ment [haha] somewhere, dude!!
